designed buildings
with elements that
evoked a sense of
anticipation in
moving from
room to room—
corridors with low
ceilings and slender
passageways
opening into

large, airy spaces with enormous features and high ceilings,
to him evoking thusly a sense of freedom and unbound wonder—
a principle he would term “compression and release.”

Strange, then,
despite having
died in ‘fifty-nine,
his hand apparently
still busy drafting
the contours of
this life, dark
years opening into
grander eras,
sixty years later.

Perhaps this poem, rising in smoke and ash, will cause him to imagine
a new design, one that rejects the catastrophes—compression—
and emphatically embraces God’s conclusion—release.
