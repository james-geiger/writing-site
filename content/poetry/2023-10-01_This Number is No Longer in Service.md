I had wondered why you weren't at my daughter's baby shower
or how come you didn't attend my birthday dinner—

Come to think of it, it seems we missed celebrating
your own birthday this year.

Your absence seemed conspicuous, though unsurprising,
as we both know your proclivity to skip these sorts of engagements.

But then I remembered where I saw you last,
and it suddenly all made sense—

My offense waned, though slowly, as
I realized I'd have to forgive your absence
at many celebrations to come.
