I am the flag of the country
chosen for her beacon—holding
hope, prosperity, stability like
water in between open fingers.

I am the social worker
called in on her day off to
respond—as a bystander
might at a burning home—
how, exactly?

I am the shop owner switching
"abrir" to "cerrado" at noon,
worried about a day of
sales lost and a dream torn
apart in a day.

I am the officer upholding the
Rule of Law that grinds
against the Law of God in the way
an ulcer is only a beginning.

I am the spouse abruptly set adrift,
unmoored, ignored, whose cries
for help at night willfully unheard
echo through the canyon formed
between intent and purpose—

I am the child whose parent
won't be home tonight—
whose chance at a carefree childhood
was destroyed for politicking, profit, greed—
whose siblings too early look to for
comfort, assurance—absent my own.

I am the child
I am the spouse
I am the officer
I am the social worker
I am the flag

whose stripes in summer heat languish,
whose winds of justice stagnate,
whose symbolism willingly fouled.

You are the immigrant,
undocumented,
unvalued,
inhuman—except—

fearfully and wonderfully made.
