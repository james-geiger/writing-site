Clouds having given way to sunshine on this June afternoon,
a family sits silently together on the sunporch, senses
dulled by their recent loss, though noticing the humidity.

Their dad
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;granddad
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;husband
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;lays in the next room, finally.
His spirit, evaporating in the heat, adds only more moisture to an
environment ripe for rage, catalyzed by the dissonant mourning
for this dearly departed thorn bush—untamed, unpruned, vengeful.

Fueled by hot moisture, instability, a life spent at odds with itself,
the spirit slowly growing fifty thousand feet into the stratosphere,
no longer bound by the limitations of his physical body, 
a cathartic feedback loop of air molecules—

rising
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;falling
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;rage
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;calm reaching its fever pitch in some
proximal field, victim of happenstance, the chaotic wind leaving 
behind crops blown over and carved into a meandering stream,
one final path of destruction left in his wake, dissipating at last—
tired, docile, now a suitable offering for the afterlife.

The meteorologist in some distant forecast office not having
even noticed this short-lived twister in the middle of Nowhere.
They'll keep watching the sweep on their monitors, drinking their
coffee, thinking about what to eat tonight for dinner.

Though we out here are left to tidy up this mess, the winds
calm and air cool, as we wait to bear the brunt
of the next one to die without having
fully satisfied the grudge they
held against themself
all these
years.
