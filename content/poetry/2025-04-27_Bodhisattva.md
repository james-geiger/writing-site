Where do we learn
the delicate art
of thinking our life
is more precious
than our neighbor’s?

Is it in the pews
of a church, holy rollers
preaching that our dogma
confers upon us some
unquestionable superiority?

Could it be our own
parents, caring for us
like a precious gem
from the day we were
suddenly forced into consciousness?

Perhaps it is some deep
dark thing within us,
Freud’s Id, the constant
thumping drumbeat of
self-obsessed desire.

How can I cause this
unwelcome part of me
to come suddenly,
thoroughly, upon a
beautiful, mournless death?

Where may I address it—
packaged tightly in paper,
tied up using too much twine—
to be certain it will be
forever lost along the way?

How can I be entirely sure
that the thought will
never cross my mind again,
that my life carries
greater eternal weight

than that of a friend,
a stranger,
a bird,
water,
air?
